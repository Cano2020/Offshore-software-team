A Canopus team is a group of young people dedicated to delivering the best apps and living with them every day. All our team members experiment with new technologies on a daily basis and are always finding new ways of using them. We don’t only work with standard operating systems such as iOS, Android, and web development. We like to experiment and create apps for Google Glass, SmartWatches, BLE devices, iBeacon technologies, and Drone/UAV software.

Also, we have some very bright minds in our data science and engineering team. We provide edge data science services leveraging: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.
